            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing
                rapidly. The World Travel and
                Tourism Council calculated that tourism generated ₹16.91 lakh crore (US$240 billion) or 9.2% of India's
                GDP in 2018 and supported 42.673 million jobs, 8.1% of its total employment. The sector is predicted
                to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to ₹32.05 lakh crore (US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In
                October 2015, India's medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected
                to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek
                medical treatment.

                Over 10 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2017 compared to 8.89 million in 2016, representing
                a growth of 15.6%. Domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories numbered
                1,036.35 million in 2012, an increase of 16.5% from 2011. In 2014, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar
                Pradesh were the most popular states for tourists. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Agra and Jaipur were the
                five most visited cities of India by foreign tourists during the year 2015. Worldwide, Delhi is ranked
                28th by the number of foreign tourist arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked 30th, Chennai 43rd, Agra 45th,
                Jaipur 52nd and Kolkata 90th.

                The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report for the year 2017, ranked India 40th out of 136 countries
                overall. The report ranks the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 10th out of 136 countries.
                It mentions that India has quite good air transport (ranked 32nd), particularly given the country's
                stage of development, and reasonable ground transport infrastructure (ranked 29th). The country also
                scores high on natural and cultural resources (ranked 9th). However, some other aspects of its
                tourism infrastructure remain somewhat underdeveloped. The nation has many hotel rooms per capita by
                international comparison and low ATM penetration. The World Tourism Organization reported that
                India's receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked 16th in the world, and 7th among Asian and Pacific
                countries.

                The Ministry of Tourism designs national policies for the development and promotion of tourism. In the
                process, the Ministry consults and collaborates with other stakeholders in the sector including various
                central ministries/agencies, state governments, union territories and private sector representatives.
                Concerted efforts are being made to promote niche tourism products such as rural, cruise, medical and
                eco-tourism. The Ministry of Tourism maintains the Incredible India campaign focused on promoting
                the tourism in India.</p><br><br>
