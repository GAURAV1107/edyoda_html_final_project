        <p style="font-size: 20px;">From historical monuments to crowded shopping malls, from Mughal gardens to Delhi
            University campus, the
            capital city has multiple personalities making it 'The good, the bad and the ugly'.
            The Capital city of India and the base location to explore North India, Delhi is considered to be the city
            with a heart.

            Delhi has a plethora of things for tourists to do, and it is up to you to pick and choose which items you
            want to tick off your list, depending on what you want to see and where you want to go. If Delhi’s rich
            Mughal history pulls you, then you should take time to explore historical monuments such as the Red Fort,
            Jama Masjid, Humayun’s Tomb and Purana Qila. Delhi has famous temples scattered all across the city, a few
            noteworthy ones being the Akshardham Temple, the Lotus Temple (also known as the Bahai Temple), and the
            ISKON Temple.

            The narrow, winding lanes and bylanes of old Delhi are a testament to the former Mughal rule. Old Delhi
            houses one of the country’s oldest and busiest market – Chandni Chowk. Taking a morning walk at Lodi Gardens
            is an activity that plenty of locals indulge in, and for a very good reason. Not only are the Lodi Gardens
            aesthetically beautiful – lush, sprawling stretches of green for as long as you can see, but the gardens are
            also a place to chance across Delhi’s political and social elites.

            Central Delhi is the seat of the country’s political power, and the must-visit places here include the
            Rashtrapati Bhawan on Raisina Hill, the Rajpath, and the India Gate, all of which are very popular tourist
            attractions. The best place to visit this area is in the evening, as all the buildings are lit up, and you
            can see the Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate shining brightly.

            Delhi is more famously known for its history and culture, but it is also a gastronomical pleasure. People in
            Delhi love to eat, and tourists will find themselves spoilt for choice between the multitude of dishes on
            offer at every corner of every street. Delhi is a melting pot of diverse races and cultures, and this fact
            is amply reflected in the culinary choices of the city, which keep changing as you keep walking down
            different roads.

            Delhi is a shopper’s paradise, and the vast variety of markets in Delhi ensure that travellers go back home
            with double the luggage they came with!</p>
