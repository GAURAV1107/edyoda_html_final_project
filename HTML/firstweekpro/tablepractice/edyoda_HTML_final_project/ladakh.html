        <p style="font-size: 20px;">A land like no other with superabundance of attractions to visit and phantasmagoric
            and fabulous landscapes,
            amazing people and culture, Ladakh is truly a heaven on Earth.

            Bounded by two of the world's mightiest mountain ranges, the Great Himalaya and the Karakoram, it lies
            athwart two other, the Ladakh range and the Zanskar range. Ladakh is mystical in all the spheres it covers,
            from nature, geography, sceneries to the modest cultures that it fosters. Right from gompas to the
            sensational momos, the superabundance of attractions to visit makes this city make it heaven on earth. It is
            said that only in Ladakh can a man sitting in the sun with his feet in the shade suffer from sunstroke and
            frostbite at the same time.

            For those of us living in the constant confusion about the difference between these twin locations,
            Leh-Ladakh, here is something that might help you. The state of Jammu and Kashmir is divided into three
            parts: Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. Ladakh, further is divided into two districts: district Leh, and district
            Kargil. The former district has a popular town “Leh”and is a great tourist attraction because of its
            beautiful monasteries, picturesque locations, and interesting markets defining the culture of the place.</p>
