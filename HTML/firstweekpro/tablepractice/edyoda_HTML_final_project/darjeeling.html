        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Jaw-dropping locales, mesmerising sunrises,
            the untouched beauty of the hills, the
            old-world charm of the
            past, and the welcoming smiles of the local people all add up to make Darjeeling one of the most beautiful
            hill stations in Eastern part of India. Spread over a steep mountain ridge, nestled amidst acres of lush
            green tea plantations, Darjeeling stands at the height of 2,050 meters above sea level, thus boasting of
            cool climes all year round. This scenic hill station is the perfect getaway for a romantic honeymoon and is
            just around 700 kilometres away from Kolkata.

            A respite from the hot and humid summers of India, Darjeeling is a popular tourist destination in North-East
            India. Providing a heady mixture of splendid tea gardens on rolling mountain slopes, meandering toy train
            rides through the picturesque city, and delectable traditional Tibetan cuisine, Darjeeling works wonders to
            cater to the gorgeous panorama of the Himalayas.

            There is a reason the city is known as the 'Queen of the Himalayas'. The lush green slopes dotted with women
            plucking tea leaves is a sight as mesmerising as no other. There are over 86 tea estates in Darjeeling that
            are responsible for producing the worldwide famous 'Darjeeling Tea'. Have a cup of locally brewed chai at
            the tea estate, or get down amidst the plantations to pluck a few tea leaves yourself, you are free to take
            your pick!

            A previous summer capital of India under the British Raj, Darjeeling has come off age as one of the most
            sought after hill stations in India. Famous for its beautiful tea plantations and the quality of Darjeeling
            tea, Darjeeling is a delight for all kind of tourists. The toy train established back in 1881, still runs in
            this part and is also one of the UNESCO World Heritage sites. Beautiful colonial architecture including
            mansions and churches dot this little beautiful town. Filled with people from Tibet, Nepal, nearby Indian
            states and the Gorkhas, Darjeeling is brimming with cultural diversity. The third highest peak in the world
            and the highest in India, the Kanchenjunga peak is clearly visible from here and you can enjoy a panoramic
            view of the peak. Some of Darjeeling's most popular attractions include monasteries, botanical gardens, a
            zoo, and the Darjeeling-Rangeet Valley Passenger Ropeway cable car which happens to be the longest Asian
            cable car. Darjeeling is a wonderful place to walk around and explore the tea estates, villages, and
            markets.</p>
